        Hi {{user.get_full_name}},
        <br><br><br>
        Greetings!
        <br><br><br>
        You are just a step away from accessing your Panaya account
        <br><br><br>
        We are sharing a verification code to access your account. The code is valid for 15 minutes and usable
        only once.
        <br><br><br>
        Once you have verified the code, you'll be prompted to set a new password immediately. This is to ensure
        that only you have access to your account.
        <br><br><br>
        Your OTP: {{otp}}
        <br>
        Expires in: 15 minutes
        <br><br><br><br>
        Thank you,
        Team Panaya    
    </p>
