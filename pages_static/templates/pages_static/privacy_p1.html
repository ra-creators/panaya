        your personal information will be handled by these providers.</p>

        different jurisdiction than either you or us. So if you elect to proceed with a transaction that involves the
        services of a third-party service provider, then your information may become subject to the laws of the
        jurisdiction(s) in which that service provider or its facilities are located.</p>

    <p>Protecting your privacy and the safety of your data is very important to us. To learn what data we collect and
        how we use it, and the choices you have with regard to your data, please view our privacy policy above. If you
        would like to opt out, please continue reading below.</p>

    <h4>HOW TO OPT OUT</h4>

    <p>If you would like to opt out of the “sale” of your data, or exercise any of the other rights mentioned above, you
        may click the appropriate link below or email us with your request at banaras@panaya.com </p>

    <p>If you choose to opt out using the links below, we will ask for your email address. You must provide this in
        order to proceed. We will then send a message to that address. You must reply from the same email address to
        complete the process. This step is so we can authenticate your identity and prevent fraud and abuse. If you wish
        to opt out multiple email addresses, you must provide each address to us. This is because we have no reasonable
        way to link a single address you give us to other addresses you may have.</p>

    <p>Please note that if you send us an email at [email address] us to opt out instead of using the links below, we
        will have no way of setting the cookie on your device that tells us not to “sell” your personal data, which will
        limit our ability to prevent the “sale” of your data. For this reason, the links below are the most complete way
        to opt out. </p>

    <p>Please also note that if you do opt out using the links below, but then delete the cookie, or return via a
        different browser or device, we will not be able to connect the session to your opt-out, thus cannot prevent the
        “sale” of your data.</p>


    <h5>RIGHT TO BE FORGOTTEN</h5>

    <p>Use this option if you want to remove your personal and other data from our store. Keep in mind that this process
        will delete your account, so you will no longer be able to access or use it anymore.
    </p>
