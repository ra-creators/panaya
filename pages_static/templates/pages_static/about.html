Preserving the highest level of traditional artistry and handicrafts of Banaras, while also never losing the modern touch, is the vision of Panaya.

Each of our saree is handwoven over several months, benchmarking excellence in 
quality of materials and designs, which attempt to match historical masterpieces. 
These sarees are also easy to wear and very comfortable, making you feel completely at home when you drape it, bringing out the radiant charm in every woman. 
Each saree has a story to tell, as each Panaya product has been made by careful detailing by the hands of a trained, dedicated artisan with skills which are passed down through generations and generations beyond generations. 
Let's restore the timeless bond with these sarees from the timeless collection of Banarasi sarees from Panaya.
