                        The art and culture of providing Banarasi sarees with silks is very ancient. The continuations of passing down the culture of
                        artistry of the Banarasi sarees from one generation to another have never stopped. Persian motifs were being mixed up with the design of Indian silk
                        for creating this distinctive flowery pattern of Banarasi silk sarees, which are so typical in present days.
